# Modern JavaScript for the Impatient

 Source code for the book Modern JavaScript for the Impatient by Cay S. Horstmann.
 
 ## Book description
 
JavaScript was originally designed for small-scale programming in web browsers, but modern JavaScript is radically different. Nowadays, JavaScript programmers actively embrace functional, object-oriented, and asynchronous programming, while deprecating error-prone concepts from the past. Modern JavaScript for the Impatient is a complete yet concise guide to JavaScript E6 and beyond. Rather than first requiring you to learn and transition from older versions, it helps you quickly get productive with today’s far more powerful versions and rapidly move from languages such as Java, C#, C, or C++.

Bestselling programming author Cay S. Horstmann covers all you need to know, provided in small chunks organized for quick access and easy understanding. Horstmann’s practical insights and sample code help you take advantage of all that’s new, avoid common pitfalls and obsolete features, and make the most of modern JavaScript’s robust toolchains and frameworks.
